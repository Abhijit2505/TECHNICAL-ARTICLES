      <h1> Hey There ! This is Abhijit Tripathy Here</h1>
      <p>
        I have the attitude of a learner, the courage of an entrepreneur and the thinking of an optimist,engraved inside me. I wish to be a leader in my community of people.
My interest lies in writing both technical/non-technical blogs and teaching people with some skills. I am a hardcore programmer, a Machine Learning enthusiast and an Opensource contributor. My hobbies include Graphic Designing, Reading Novels, Journals and listening to music.
From an engineering perspective, I have chosen "Data Science and Machine" Learning as my specialization fields.

        </li>
        <h5>GeeksForGeeks</h5>
        <p>
          Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing
          video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed
          to be used with the Python programming language.

          <h3><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-manipulattion-in-python-using-pandas/">Data Manipulation in Python using Pandas</a></h3>
        </li>
        <h5>GeeksForGeeks</h5>
        <p>
          In Machine Learning, the model requires a dataset to operate, i.e. to
          train and test. But data doesn’t come fully prepared and ready to use.
          There are discrepancies like “Nan”/ “Null” / “NA” values in many rows
          and columns. Sometimes the data set also contains some of the row and
          columns which are not even required in the operation of our model. In
          such conditions, it requires proper cleaning and modification of the
          data set to make it an efficient input for our model. We achieve that
          by practicing “Data Wrangling” before giving data input to the model.
